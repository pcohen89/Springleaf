## General comments
This is my repository for the Springleaf Kaggle competition. I am moving cities and jobs during this competition so I will probably not have much time to work.
Anyway. First reaction to this problem is that it must be a filtering question. Lots of variables implies to me that you probably want to try a bunch of different filter-algorithm pairs and do blending from that. Haven't looked into it too much, and I suspect this will close before I get a hardware setup that I can use.
My naive data cleaning has just blown up the memory and I am not sure why (loaded data is ~20% of memory, doing something simple (like cleaning NAs) suddenly it's performing switching). 

Edit 10/2/15: I used tingrtu online logistic regression code. Things to optimize: penalization, interactions, variable cleaning
